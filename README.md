# bitcoinVault - open source PHP Bitcoin API Client
==============================

### PHP Bitcoin API 
extends the JSON RPC Client to communicate with a [Bitcoind server](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoind).

### Usage
Use the bitcoinClient in the /src/ folder to create a new connection to a bitcoind server that you have running. I will be adding an example.php file in the root directory that can be used as a guide.

### Requirements
+ PHP5
+ cURL support
+ SSL support (if you're using HTTPS to talk to bitcoind)
